# PDF Viewer Web Project

Created by **Daniya Meraj**, student at **New Horizon College of Engineering (NHCE)**.  
This project is a clean and simple HTML-based PDF viewer that lets users open multiple PDF files using clickable buttons.

## Features
- User-friendly interface  
- Buttons to load different PDFs  
- Embedded PDF viewer  
- Easy to edit and expand

## How It Works
All PDFs are stored inside the project folder.  
Clicking a button loads the selected PDF directly in the viewer panel.

## Purpose
Built as part of academic learning to practice HTML and create a small functional document-viewing platform.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more styling with CSS  
- Add icons and improved layout  
- Make it responsive for mobile
