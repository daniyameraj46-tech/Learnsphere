# PDF Viewer Web Project

Created by **Daniya Meraj**, student at **MVJ College of Engineering**.  
This project is a simple and organized HTML-based PDF viewer that allows users to open different PDF files using clickable buttons.

## Features
- Clean and user-friendly interface  
- Buttons to load different PDFs  
- Embedded PDF viewer on the same page  
- Easy to modify and expand

## How It Works
All PDFs are stored in the project folder.  
When a button is clicked, the selected PDF loads inside the embedded viewer.

## Purpose
This project was built to practice basic web development skills such as HTML structure, embedding files, and creating a functional mini-website for academic notes or documents.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding CSS styling  
- Adding icons and improved layout  
- Making it responsive for mobile screens
